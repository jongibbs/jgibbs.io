  heading: Great insects with no compromises

    We hold our insects to the highest standards from the shrub to the bowl.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the insect’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the buggies, farmers and the local environment.
