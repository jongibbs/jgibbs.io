  The aim of this study was to investigate: a. the effect of an
  interdisciplinary

  program of Greek traditional dance by the means of the teamwork method of

  teaching social skills to students. b. whether this effect was similar for
  boys and

  girls. The sample of the study constituted of 206 elementary school pupils
  (4th,

  5th, and 6th class). The intervention program lasted for two months. There
  were a

  total of sixteen lessons (2 per week) which concerned the acquisition of
  social

  skills through Greek traditional dance (the experimental group). The method in
  use

  was either the group divided work or teamwork. The Greek version (Masadis et
  al.,

  2016) of Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY-II) (Matson

  et al., 2012) was applied to collect the research data. This in order to be
  analysed

  required the following statistical analysis: a. Descriptive statistics b.
  t-test for

  independent sample c. Reliability analysis (Cronbach’s α) and d. Repeated

  Measures ANOVA. The findings and the evaluation of the study suggest that the

  teamwork method is the most appropriate to adopt in social skills learning for
  the

  last 3 grades of primary school and traditional dancing the best choice to
  make.
