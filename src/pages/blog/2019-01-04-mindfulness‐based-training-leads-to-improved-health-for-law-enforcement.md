  Abstract

  Meditation and mindfulness training may play a significant role in reducing
  chronic stress and providing coping tools for the daily rigors police officers
  and law enforcement officials face, according to a study from the Pacific
  University School of Graduate Psychology. The research was led by professors
  Mike Christopher and Matthew Hunsinger, who compared a control group of
  officers who underwent no meditation and mindfulness‐based resilience training
  with a group of local officers who underwent training for eight weeks.
  Findings were published in the June 2018 issue of Psychiatry Research.
