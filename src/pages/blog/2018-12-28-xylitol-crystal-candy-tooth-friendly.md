Xylitol Crystal Candy - Tooth Friendly!

xylitol

flavored oil or concentrated candy flavoring (LorAnn Oils or similar, NOT alcohol based extracts such as vanilla)

cream of tatar (potassium bitartrate) (NOT tartaric acid)

citric acid - fine crystals or powder. Sometimes sold as 'sour salt' for cooking

Equipment:

double boiler or two nesting saucepans

silicone baking mat or heavy duty aluminum foil

stove top, burner or other controlled heat source

small kitchen scale or set of small measuring spoons (1/16 teaspoon, 1/8 teaspoon etc.)

Packaging:

Glass Mason jar (1/2 cup size), or

Small metal tin with tight fitting lide (Altoids or similar size), or

Food safe plastic container

Step 3: Making the Xylitol Candy & the Recipe

Picture of Making the Xylitol Candy & the Recipe

General Process:

1. Melt xylitol, cream of tartar and citric acid to make syrup
2. Remove from heat and add flavoring
3. Pour syrup out onto cooling surface
4. Let crystalize/set
5. Break into serving size pieces

No need for candy thermometer. DO NOT add water to make the xylitol syrup (unlike what you do for sugar hard candy or taffy).

Xylitol Crystal Candy Recipe

1/2 c. xylitol (sugar alcohol)

1/16 tsp. (1 pinch, .4 gram) cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate)

1/16 teaspoon (1 pinch, .4 gram) citric acid

Flavoring (cinnamon oil/cassia oil or LorAnn oils – highly concentrated flavorings) DO NOT use vanilla extract or other cooking extracts with water- they are two weak and the water will interfere with crystallization (hardening) of the xylitol.

Step 4: It's All in the Details

Details:

1. Use a double boiler (or a small pan floating in a pan of boiling water)- do not let water splash into the xylitol – it will interfere with crystallization)
2. Place xylitol, cream of tartar and citric acid into top of double boiler, mix well. Heat over boiling water (simmer) until melted.Should take about 15-20 minutes to melt.
3. Crystal will melt around the edges first, then gradual wet the entire pile of ingredients. Do not stir until everything is ‘wet’ looking. Best to let it melt without stirring until it is a pretty clear syrup.
4. You can stir last few lumps, but more stirring seems to produce more small crystals in the final candy. Syrup crystalizes very quickly on the spoon, so use a fresh spoon each time. The goal is a clear syrup.
5. When fully melted, turn off heat. Quickly stir in flavoring (2-4 drops pure oil or up to 1/16 tsp LorAnn oil). Note: Ingredients for LorAnn oils can include: Natural and/or artificial flavoring, alcohol, propylene glycol, glycerin, water, color. I got harder candy using flavorings with less water, the ones that listed other ingredients before water.
6. After adding flavor, remove top of double boiler and quickly wipe the bottom dry with a cotton towel.

7. Immediately pour syrup onto a silicone baking mat or a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil (shiny side up). Work fast and efficiently – more scrapping of the pan seems to cause more crystals to form. If the syrup freezes in the pan before you get it all out, reheat pan over boiling water to re-melt and finish pouring. Best if the mat or foil is on top of an insulated surface (airbake cookie sheet, wood cutting board – not cold stone countertop). We want the crystals to for slowly so they are bigger and harder.
8. Let syrup self-level, should be about 1/8-3/16 inches (3-4mm) thick.
9. Set aside in dust free area to set. White/opaque areas of sheet crystal will form, usually starting in the areas where the last bits of scrapped syrup fell. Good candy will form shiny flat crystal sheets. It may take up to 3-4 hours for sheet to fully crystalize. If the whole things sets in less than five minutes you might find the candy is fragile and grainy as it is made up of many tiny crystals. In this case, you can re-melt the candy, adding extra acid. The flavoring may evaporate, so add a little more right before you pour the syrup.
10. Break candy into small pieces (about thumbnail size), put into decorative tin, glass mason jar or plastic container with a tight lid. Keep xylitol dry and it will stay fresh for months. (I’ve never had any last longer than a couple months before it got eaten). Xylitol does not seem to absorb moisture like sugar candy does, so it’s unlikely to get sticky and should keep a long time.
