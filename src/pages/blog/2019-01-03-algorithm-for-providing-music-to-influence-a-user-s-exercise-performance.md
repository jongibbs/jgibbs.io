  Abstract

  Aspects of the invention use music to influence a person's performance in a
  physical workout. A computing device receives and analyzes data indicating
  current physiology and movement of the user in order to provide a music piece
  that will influence the user to speed up, slow down, or maintain current pace
  so to achieve a desired exercise performance level. Information specific to
  the user may be considered in providing the music piece.
