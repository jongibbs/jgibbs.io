  What would happen if a computer hacker could access the neural information of
  the president of the United States and revealed the nation’s next military
  objectives? Or what if the hacker discovered the president suffers from a
  mental illness and disclosed this information to the press? Or even worse… How
  much would a rival country pay for such information? We are entering the era
  of neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces, which is a technology that
  connects people’s brains directly to mobile phones and computers. But… is this
  technology really safe against cyber attacks? And what actions should be taken
  by manufacturers, users, and governments to address this new security
  scenario?
