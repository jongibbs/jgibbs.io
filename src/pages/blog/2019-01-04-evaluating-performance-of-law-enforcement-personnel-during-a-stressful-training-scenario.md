  Abstract: Police trainees who were ready to graduate from the Federal Law
  Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) volunteered to participate in an exercise
  designed to evaluate their survivability. In a highly stressful interactive
  scenario, which included a hostage situation, performance was evaluated for a
  range of responses, including: shooting judgment and accuracy, communications,
  and coping with a weapon malfunction. Nineteen percent of subjects shot the
  hostage, a failure rate that falls in the reported range of friendly fire
  casualties in military combat. The Spielberger Trait Anger Scale showed an
  association with shot placement and performance during the gunfight as well as
  with overall performance scores.
