Introduction

Permaculture design is an ethically based, whole-systems design approach to create sustainable human settlements and institutions. Although rooted in horticulture and agriculture, permaculture design also touches on regional planning, ecology, animal husbandry, technology, architecture and international development.



Our Permaculture Design Course Equips You to Create a Design in 10 Weeks

Our online, instructor-led Permaculture Design Certificate helps you successfully employ permaculture philosophies and techniques.



Within a collaborative, academically rigorous curriculum, you will complete regenerative landscape projects with intensive instructor feedback and one-on-one interaction to help with every step along the way. You will learn or expand your skills of translating site observations and designs to paper or digital applications such as Powerpoint and Google Slides.



Augmented Reality for Permaculture Designs



Recently Redesigned Course Curriculum

Our Permaculture Design Certificate was recently redesigned based off previous participant feedback, and this is your first opportunity to take advantage of this new material. Updates include:



Course curriculum reordered to be up-to-date with latest pedagogical developments in the permaculture field.

Assignments redeveloped and refined based on feedback from students and instructors.

A custom report template created that you can use for all assignments, which becomes the permaculture design report for your project. This templates includes user-friendly assessment and design graphic tools for you to work with.

All new videos of thriving permaculture systems from multiple countries and climate zones.

New multimedia "lightboard" presentations covering an array of topics.

A new series of presentations created in an Augmented Reality Sandbox to show 3D animations of water flow in permaculture systems.

Each of these changes utilize the latest technologies and insights from our instructors for an online course experience that will allow you to thrive.



Engage With an Online Community

You will engage with peers through the program’s discussion boards, where you can receive and provide feedback and follow each project’s progress. You will learn from peers by sharing your own permaculture design plan and viewing other projects from diverse climates and environments.



This course is primarily focused on the U.S., but it is possible for international students to succeed with extra work and effort. Previous participants have come from locations all around the world, and have created design plans for sites that ranged in size from urban balconies to 100-acre ranches. View examples of previous student projects.



This course is led by OSU instructor Andrew Millison and Marisha Auerbach, who have benefited thousands of students by sharing insights from his 20+ years of experience in permaculture design. By learning one-on-one with Andrew, Marisha and their team, you can avoid common mistakes and receive experienced guidance throughout the process. After successful completion of the Permaculture Design Certificate Online, consider enrolling in the Advanced Permaculture Design Practicum.



Is This Course Right for You?

This class offers an intensive experience that doesn't work for everyone's learning type and schedule. This course is right for you if:



You are an overachiever who is analytical in nature

You are driven and regularly find yourself in awe of nature

You work well in an online environment or are willing to put in the effort this type of learning requires

You are independently motivated and have the time to put into this course

You have a physical site that you can visit during this course

We are excited to work with a variety of learners, and we guarantee an education you won't find elsewhere. In just ten weeks, you will be introduced to the theory, concepts, tools and techniques of permaculture design. You will build a draft design from a property of your choice with feedback from full-time permaculture designers, teachers and practitioners. At the end, you will have a first draft for the property of your choice that is an essential first step to building a working design that you can implement.



You will have access to the course content after completion to go back to and help you further refine your landscape design. If you find that you want even more guidance from our expert instructors, you will also have the option to take this course again at a substantial discount.



For a small fee, you can extend your time in the course to 20 weeks and take your time to get the most out of the experience.

Here are just a few additional thoughts from some of the students who have taken this course.



"I am loving how each week I am having so many moments where I think…”I never thought of that. It’s a great idea that could work.” And everywhere I go I am observing so many possibilities for change. I feel like I am at the beginning of my college experience, instead of 20 plus years past it. There are many ideas I want to incorporate as part of my permaculture design, but my challenge is having a small design site and packin
