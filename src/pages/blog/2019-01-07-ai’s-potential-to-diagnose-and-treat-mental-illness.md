title: AI’s Potential to Diagnose and Treat Mental Illness

  The United States faces a mental health epidemic. Nearly one in five American
  adults suffers from a form of mental illness. Suicide rates are at an all-time
  high, 115 people die daily from opioid abuse, and one in eight Americans over
  12 years’ old take an antidepressant every day. The economic burden of
  depression alone is estimated to be at least $210 billion annually, with more
  than half of that cost coming from increased absenteeism and reduced
  productivity in the workplace.


  In a crisis that has become progressively dire over the past decade, digital
  solutions — many with artificial intelligence (AI) at their core — offer hope
  for reversing the decline in our mental wellness. New tools are being
  developed by tech companies and universities with potent diagnostic and
  treatment capabilities that can be used to serve large populations at
  reasonable costs.


  AI solutions are arriving at an opportune time. The nation is confronting a
  critical shortfall in psychiatrists and other mental health specialists that
  is exacerbating the crisis. Nearly 40% of Americans live in areas designated
  by the federal government as having a shortage of mental health professionals;
  more than 60% of U.S. counties are without a single psychiatrist within their
  borders. Those fortunate enough to live in areas with sufficient access to
  mental health services often can’t afford them because many therapists don’t
  accept insurance.
