  SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CB Therapeutics utilizes sustainable
  microorganisms and its proprietary biotechnology platform to produce
  therapeutic compounds found in cannabis without the land and water resource
  drain of growing plants. Through biosynthesis, CB Therapeutics has produced
  not only popular phytocannabinoids like CBD, but also other rare cannabinoids
  that not been previously available due to the difficulty and cost of
  extraction from plants.


  “Traditionally terpenes and cannabinoids have been extracted from plants, but
  now we have another source of production that is one giant leap for the whole
  industry. One of the advantages for this technology is how much less resources
  are needed, creating a win-win for all.”

  CB Therapeutics has now successfully produced a variety of different terpenes
  traditionally found in cannabis and many other plant varieties. “Using our
  technology for environmentally sustainable production of terpenes was the
  natural extension to our proprietary platform given we started with
  phytocannabinoids,” stated Dr. Jacob Vogan, CSO. “Traditionally terpenes and
  cannabinoids have been extracted from plants, but now we have another source
  of production that is one giant leap for the whole industry. One of the
  advantages for this technology is how much less resources are needed, creating
  a win-win for all.”


  “With the evolution of the cannabis industry comes proliferation of many new
  and innovative products. Aside from cannabinoids, we are now seeing that
  terpenes have many interesting synergistic effects, such as the entourage
  effect, hence the market demand for products with well-balanced terpene
  ratios,” stated Sher Butt, CEO. With the ability to make terpenes as well as
  cannabinoids, CB Therapeutics is the first biosynthetic company offering a
  total solution for cannabinoid products, enabling specific ratios of
  cannabinoids and terpenes on demand.
