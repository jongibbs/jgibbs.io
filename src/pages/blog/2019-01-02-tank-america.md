Tank America is located in scenic Brevard County only 50 minutes from Orlando. This high adventure theme park is located on 35 lush acres of land that includes a 5 acre deep water lake, plenty of jungle terrain, and rolling trails cutting through the forest. The topography features a 1/2 mile course which billows up steep hills, traverses mud holes, whips around hair pin turns and across straightaways. Tank America puts you in the middle of the action and directly in the driver’s seat as you navigate across the landscape in a FV433 Abbot military tank, filled with adrenaline as you lay waste to everything in your path.

Our unique attraction includes a 20,000 square foot air-conditioned building built out with a period specific military theme for high intensity, incredibly authentic tactical laser tag. From the military themed wall decorations to the props populating the area – players will feel immersed in realistic combat conditions. Our facility offers many replica weapons, including a 50 caliber gun and several WWII era machine guns. Tank America is conveniently located just 2 miles off of Route 95. Join us for the thrill of a lifetime!
