  In an exploratory survey that sampled video gamers, participants were asked to
  indicate why they enjoy playing their favorite video game. On the basis of
  ESRB ratings, we compare those whose favorite game is violent to those whose
  favorite game is nonviolent. Consistent with self-determination theory, the
  findings suggest need for autonomy and competence are important motivating
  factors. However, the findings also suggest fans of violent games differed
  from fans of nonviolent games in the degree to which arousal, liking violence,
  playing the vicarious hero, and playing the vicarious villain drive enjoyment.
  Furthermore, being able to play the hero and “fight bad guys” was a
  significant predictor of enjoyment of violent games. Implications for
  self-determination theory and theories of media enjoyment are discussed.
