  Everyone has a story to tell, but because of trauma, not everyone can use
  words to tell it. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate an arts-based,
  trauma-informed, hope-infused movement and storytelling curriculum for adults
  (ages 19+) who are in recovery from various addictions or traumatic
  experiences. The curriculum was implemented with a group of five people
  selected by the supervising agency (Kingdom Recovery) to assess whether or not
  it proved beneficial to the participants. Assessment methods included
  before/after class experiences, a movement assessment checklist, and an
  evaluation survey. The curriculum consisted of seven lessons lasting 90
  minutes each, and the goal of the curriculum was to promote life-skill
  building, healing, and hope. At the end of the seven-week time period,
  subjects performed pieces they choreographed throughout the sessions as a
  celebration of their accomplishments and hard work. The goals of the
  curriculum were accomplished successfully and 100% of the participants noticed
  an increase in their confidence, empathy, and creativity.
