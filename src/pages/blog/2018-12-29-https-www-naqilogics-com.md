  Inventing the Future

  Naqi Logics has a strong patent portfolio that focuses on logic frameworks
  that will ultimately serve as the world's first Cognitive Operating System
  (COS) which would be used through a Cognitive User Interface (CUI), as opposed
  to the traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI).

While the entire world seems to be focusing on control methods that require a separate GUI, we are striving to invent methods of controlling information systems without looking at them, touching them or speaking to them.



​



Naqi Logics is partnered with Harrisburg University and is a part of the Harrisburg University Start-up Incubator.  We are actively seeking investors and strategic partners to bring our intellectual property into the marketplace.



THE NAQI FRAMEWORK

Naqi Logics uses the same logic framework whether we're developing a true thought-controlled application (EEG >> action/executable) or a micro-gestural application (micro movement >> action/executable).

RUNES



​



Runes are two or more imagined directions assigned to any number of words, executions, procedures or functions.  Think of a Rune as being a cognitive icon.  Like icons, Runes can be assigned to any word, sentence, phrase, paragraph or any execution, command, procedure, function or macro.  In the same way that a file folder icon can represent a virtual location with the OS, a Rune can also represent the location of a Plaque.

PLAQUES



​



Plaques are locations that keep closely related Runes together.  In many ways, a Plaque can be thought of as a cognitive file folder.  Plaques are organized on the Z-Axis.



​



CRYPTS



​



Crypts are the collection of all Plaques within the database.  Crypts store all Runes and Plaques in the exact order determined by the user.
