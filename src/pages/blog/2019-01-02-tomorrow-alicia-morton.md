The sun'll come out tomorrow

Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

There'll be sun

Just thinkin' about tomorrow

Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

'Til there's none



When I'm stuck a with day that's gray and lonely

I just stick out my chin and grin, and say, oh



The sun'll come out tomorrow

So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow

Come what may



Tomorrow, tomorrow

I love ya tomorrow

You're always a day away

Tomorrow, tomorrow

I love ya tomorrow

You're always a day away

Tomorrow, tomorrow

I love ya tomorrow

You're always a day away
