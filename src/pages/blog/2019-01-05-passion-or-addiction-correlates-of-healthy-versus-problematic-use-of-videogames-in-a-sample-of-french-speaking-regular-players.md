  videogames in a sample of French-speaking regular players

  A criticism of current diagnostic approaches to gaming disorder is that they
  fail to take into account that high and repeated engagement is not problematic
  per se, nor is it necessarily associated with adverse consequences. To tackle
  this controversy, we used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test, in
  regular gamers (N = 268), whether high (but healthy) engagement can be
  distinguished from problematic engagement by using the Addiction-Engagement
  Questionnaire (Charlton & Danforth, 2007). We then tested whether differential
  relationships exist between the engagement and addiction constructs, DSM-5
  criteria for Internet gaming disorder (IGD), and psychological factors linked
  to gaming use and misuse (self-reported impulsivity, motives to play, and
  depression). Results indicated that a model holding engagement and addiction
  as two distinct, but related, constructs fits the data well. Second, we showed
  that although both constructs are linked to the number of IGD criteria
  endorsed, the relationship is more pronounced for the addiction construct.
  Third, a differential pattern of correlations was observed with the other
  study variables, further supporting the need to distinguish the two
  constructs. Our study emphasizes that research is needed to refine the
  diagnostic approach to gaming disorder to avoid conflating healthy passion
  with pathological behavior.
