  Depression is a huge problem for millions of people, and it is often
  compounded by poor mental-health support and stigma. Early diagnosis can help,
  but many mental disorders are difficult to detect. The machine-learning
  algorithms that let smartphones identify faces or respond to our voices could
  help provide a universal and low-cost way of spotting the early signs and
  getting treatment where it’s needed.

  In a study carried out by a team at Stanford University, scientists found that
  face and speech software can identify signals of depression with reasonable
  accuracy.


  The researchers fed video footage of depressed and non-depressed people into a
  machine-learning model that was trained to learn from a combination of
  signals: facial expressions, voice tone, and spoken words. The data was
  collected from interviews in which a patient spoke to an avatar controlled by
  a physician.


  In testing, it was able to detect whether someone was depressed more than 80%
  of the time. The research was led by Fei-Fei Li, a prominent AI expert
