WWhat’s Included In The IV Hydration Bag

W







B Vitamins:

Vitamin B, especially B12, is important to protect the nervous system and maintain a healthy RBC production. Alcohol is a diuretic depleting vitamin and mineral levels in the body, making you feel tired, confused, and achy. Replenishing lost B vitamins helps manage hangover symptoms quickly.



C Vitamins:

Vitamin C helps the liver break down the alcohol, thus increasing the speed of metabolizing the alcohol.



Electrolytes:

Intravenous electrolytes help to restore lost minerals like magnesium, potassium, and calcium. They hydrate the body to help make you feel better quickly.



Anti-inflammatory medicines and anti-emetics:

Besides essential vitamins and minerals, we also add medicines to manage a headache, nausea, and body ache. Since these are added intravenously, you don’t have to worry about throwing up or feeling queasy.



Glutathione:

Glutathione is a very important antioxidant that works within our liver cells to neutralize free radicals and helps the body combat oxidative stress. Alcohol severely depletes glutathione levels in the body leaving you tired and stressed. When administered intravenously, glutathione helps the body feel normal again.



We also include other essential vitamins and medications in our Las Vegas IV hydration drip depending on the severity of your hangover. Call us at 702 850 4346 to know more about our hangover treatments in Las Vegas.
