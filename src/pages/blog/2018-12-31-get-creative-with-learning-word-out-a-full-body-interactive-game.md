This paper presents Word Out, an interactive game to train a child's creative thinking and problem solving capabilities through full body interaction. Targeted at children 4-7 years old, Word Out employs the Microsoft Kinect to detect the silhouette of players. Players are tasked to use their bodies to match the shapes of the alphabets displayed on the screen. Being explorative in nature, the game promotes creative learning through play, as well as encourages collaboration and kinesthetic learning for children. Over two months, more than 15,000 children have played Word Out installed in two different museums. This paper presents the design and implementation of the Word Out game and preliminary analyses of data collected at the museums to share insights on the potential of meaningful and engaging educational games that promote freedom and encourage creativity in the child.
