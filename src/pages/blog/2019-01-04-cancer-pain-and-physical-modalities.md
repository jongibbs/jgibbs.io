  Cancer pain can be quite debilitating, affecting not only quality of life and
  function, but mood and interpersonal social interactions as well. While
  pharmacologic interventions play a large role in managing cancer pain,
  patients may also benefit from physical modalities. Rehabilitation strategies
  often incorporate the use of physical modalities to reduce symptoms while
  improving or maintaining function through physical and occupational therapy.
  These modalities may be better tolerated than pharmacologic approaches alone.
  Side effects from pharmacologic therapy may limit the progression toward
  functional improvement in a rehabilitation program.


  The addition of physical modalities such as cryotherapy, massage, and
  therapeutic exercise should be considered for symptom relief. Modalities, also
  known as physical agents, can be categorized by properties: thermodynamic,
  mechanical, or electromagnetic. The use of modalities in individuals with
  cancer is highly controversial and not well studied. For example, using
  topical moist heat in an area with active cancer can provide pain modulation
  as heating tense or spastic muscles does help with relaxation. However, heat
  also increases blood flow, circulation, and thus blood volume to an area. This
  influx of volume might be contraindicated in an instance of lymphadenopathy.
  Also, with this influx of blood volume come protein, nutrients, and other
  metabolic catalysts that in theory could be providing an optimum environment
  for cancer cells to thrive. Again, the research is limited, and little can be
  said about the relationship between physical therapy modalities to cancer.
  There is limited literature on physical modalities for cancer-related pain;
  however, this chapter will review some options to consider.
