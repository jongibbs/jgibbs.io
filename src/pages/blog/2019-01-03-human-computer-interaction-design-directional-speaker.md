  Acoustic Space Delimiter – Directional Speaker

  The Acouspade™ hyper directional speaker enables you to focus a beam of sound
  to a specific point in the environment and to address the public with precise
  acoustic content at precise locations.

  The Acouspade directional speaker can deliver a narrow beam of sound to a
  desired area while preserving silence around it, or allowing the co-existence
  of different sounds in the same space without mixing or interfering. The
  audio-beam created by Acouspade can cut through noisy environments and deliver
  a headphone-like experience for the listener.


  Syntact™ musical interface is introducing a new paradigm in the field of
  human-computer interaction design. It is redefining the possibilities of
  musical interaction and enabling a playful and physical engagement in musical
  creation.

  The revolutionary technology behind Syntact™ provides contact-free tactile
  feedback to the musician. By utilizing airborne ultrasound a force field is
  created in mid-air that can be sensed in a tactile way. The interface allows a
  musician to feel the actual sound with its temporal and harmonic texture.
  While an optical sensor system is interpreting her or his hand gestures, the
  musician can physically engage with the medium of sound by virtually molding
  and shaping it – i.e. changing its acoustic appearance – directly with their
  hands.
