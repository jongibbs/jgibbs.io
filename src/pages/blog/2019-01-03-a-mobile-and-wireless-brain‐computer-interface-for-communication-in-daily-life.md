title: A mobile and wireless brain‐computer interface for communication in daily life

  Moving a brain‐computer interface (BCI) from a laboratory demonstration to
  real‐life applications poses

  severe challenges to the BCI community [1][2]. Recently, with advances in the
  biomedical sciences and

  electronic technologies, the development of a mobile and online BCI has
  obtained increasing attention

  in the past decade [3].  A mobile BCI has the advantage of ultimate
  portability as well as a low system

  cost derived from using customized Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and
  signal processing

  modules. To implement a mobile BCI with online processing, a mobile terminal
  such as a mobile phone

  or a PDA might be an ideal platform for data transmission, signal processing,
  and feedback presentation.

  In this study, we aim to integrate a wearable and wireless EEG system with a
  mobile phone to

  implement a visual‐evoked potential (VEP) based BCI, which can be used to
  directly make phone calls

  based on users’ EEG.
