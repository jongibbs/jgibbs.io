  The test results indicate that there is no significant difference between the
  two study groups before the intervention with respect to the mean values of
  seven intelligence subscales. Thus, the children were matched with respect to
  their intelligence. On the other hand, the study results after the
  intervention show that music teaching could significantly affect all
  creativity components (fluidity, flexibility, innovation, and expansion). In
  other words, teaching music with Orff method over a three-month period
  influenced the creativity of the studied children.
