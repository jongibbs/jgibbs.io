You got that, you got that, you got that milk money

I got that, I got that, I got that MILF money

You got that, you got that, you got that milk money

I got that, I got that, I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

Heard you in the mood for a little MILFshake

Welcome to the Dairy Dutchess Love Factory

I could whip it up, fix you up straight away

Come on in the front door, leaving at the back door

Whip it, flip it, hey

Been working at your service to give it to ya

Didn't mean to make you nervous, you mother, mother

You got that, you got that, you got that milk money

I got that, I got that, I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

Me and the girls, up in the club

Hating-ass hoes, but I don't give a fuck

Running amok, owning the spot

Buying the bar like I bought all these rocks

I been working all week, now where the hell is my drink?

Hair and nails is on fleek

All my girls on fleek

'Cause we I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T

Do you know what that means?

Can't see me

B-R-O-K-E

I'm P-A-I-D , you heard about me, I'm saying

You got that, you got that, you got that milk money

I got that, I got that, I got that MILF money

You got that, you got that, you got that milk money

I got that, I got that, I got that MILF

I've been whippin' this up

I've been tippin' this cup

I've been waiting my turn

I've been working so hard

Got my spirit turnt up

And I can't stop now

I've been running so long

I been vibing so strong

I want it, I need it, I got it for real

I love it, real woman

I'll feed you this meal

Hey mama, I did it, the top of the hill

Been a minute, don't forget it, mother, mother I'm ill

Now lemme see you milfshake

(Lemme see you milfshake)

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

(Lemme see you milfshake)

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

I got that MILF money

Been working at your service to give it to ya

Didn't mean to make you nervous

To give it to ya

You mother, mother
