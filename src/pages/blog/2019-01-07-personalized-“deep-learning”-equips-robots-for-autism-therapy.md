title: Personalized “deep learning” equips robots for autism therapy

  This type of therapy works best, however, if the robot can smoothly interpret
  the child’s own behavior — whether he or she is interested and excited or
  paying attention — during the therapy. Researchers at the MIT Media Lab have
  now developed a type of personalized machine learning that helps robots
  estimate the engagement and interest of each child during these interactions,
  using data that are unique to that child.
