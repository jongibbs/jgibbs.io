  “To be a good lawyer, one has to be a healthy lawyer. Sadly, our profession is
  falling short when it comes to well-being.” So begins the ABA’s recent report,
  The Path to Lawyer Well-Being: Practical Recommendations for Positive Change.
  The report recommends mindfulness meditation as a practice that can improve
  resilience and reduce stress, depression, and anxiety, and that can enhance
  many lawyering competencies, including improved attention and focus, critical
  cognitive skills, and ethical and rational decision-making. Above all,
  mindfulness fosters self-awareness and a habit of self-reflection, both of
  which are integral parts of experiential learning and the development of
  professional identity.


  Increasingly, law schools across the country are incorporating innovative
  mindfulness-based programming into their curricula, for the skills and values
  promoted by mindfulness are central to becoming an effective, well-balanced
  practicing lawyer. Externship programs are particularly well-suited to
  offering mindfulness-based practices to law students as clinicians help to
  foster these professional skills and values. In addition to mindfulness and
  meditation, the ABA report also mentions yoga as among the restorative
  practices that lawyers and law schools are encouraged to incorporate into
  their programs to promote personal and professional well-being.


  This session will introduce new and experienced clinicians to mindfulness, its
  many benefits, and the science that supports it. It will engage participants
  in several short meditation practices and exercises, and will explore
  different approaches to incorporating these practices into the externship
  experience. Finally, this session will emphasize that these practices are not
  just for students, and that we as educators and role models should adopt them
  or other restorative practices as part of our own self-care plans by which we
  can nourish ourselves and promote our own health and well-being.
