  Abstract_

  Sugar consumption is assumed to induce a behavioral state that is similar to
  the one provoked by addictive substances. Drug withdrawal increases
  impulsivity, assessed by differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL)
  performance. The present study investigated the effect of withdrawal from a
  prolonged period of sugar consumption on DRL performance. Water-deprived rats
  were trained under a DRL 20 s (DRL 20) schedule. The animals were allowed to
  choose between plain water and a sucrose solution (E group) or water only (C
  group) for 30 days. The sucrose solution was then removed, and measures of DRL
  20 performance were obtained on 3 consecutive days. Results showed that DRL
  performance in the C group improved after sugar withdrawal, whereas
  performance in the E group led to the loss of reinforcers. An analysis of
  variance-type analysis showed that the E group had higher response rates per
  reinforcer, lower IRTs, and greater differences between baseline and
  abstinence than the C group after 3 days of sugar withdrawal. Thus, sugar
  abstinence after a relatively long consumption period resulted in impairment
  of DRL performance, confirming the parallel effects of addictive drugs and
  sugar and suggesting an increase in impulsivity as a consequence of sugar
  deprivation.
