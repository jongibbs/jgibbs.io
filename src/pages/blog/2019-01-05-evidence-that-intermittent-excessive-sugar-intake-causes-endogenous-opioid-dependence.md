  Objective: The goal was to determine whether withdrawal from sugar can cause
  signs of opioid dependence. Because palatable food stimulates neural systems
  that are implicated in drug addiction, it was hypothesized that intermittent,
  excessive sugar intake might create dependency, as indicated by withdrawal
  signs......

  Research Methods and Procedures: Male rats were food‐deprived for 12 hours
  daily, including 4 hours in the early dark, and then offered highly palatable
  25% glucose in addition to chow for the next 12 hours. Withdrawal was induced
  by naloxone or food deprivation. Withdrawal signs were measured by
  observation, ultrasonic recordings, elevated plus maze tests, and in vivo
  microdialysis............


  Results: Naloxone (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) caused somatic signs, such as
  teeth chattering, forepaw tremor, and head shakes. Food deprivation for 24
  hours caused spontaneous withdrawal signs, such as teeth chattering. Naloxone
  (3 mg/kg subcutaneously) caused reduced time on the exposed arm of an elevated
  plus maze, where again significant teeth chattering was recorded. The plus
  maze anxiety effect was replicated with four control groups for comparison.
  Accumbens microdialysis revealed that naloxone (10 and 20 mg/kg
  intraperitoneally) decreased extracellular dopamine (DA), while
  dose‐dependently increasing acetylcholine (ACh). The naloxone‐induced DA/ACh
  imbalance was replicated with 10% sucrose and 3 mg/kg naloxone
  subcutaneously.............


  Discussion: Repeated, excessive intake of sugar created a state in which an
  opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid
  withdrawal. The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh imbalance were qualitatively
  similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine, suggesting that the rats had
  become sugar‐dependent.
