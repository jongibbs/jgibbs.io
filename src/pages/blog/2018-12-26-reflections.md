I talk, but I do not speak my mind



I hear words, but I do not listen to thoughts



When I wake, all see me



When I sleep, all hear me



Many heads are on my shoulders



Many hands are at my feet



The strongest steel cannot break my visage



But the softest whisper can destroy me



The quietest whimper can be heardheard-TR
