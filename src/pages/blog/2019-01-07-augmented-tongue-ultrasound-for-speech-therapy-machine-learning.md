title: Augmented tongue ultrasound for speech therapy Machine Learning

description: >-
  The strength of this new system lies in a machine learning algorithm that
  researchers have been working on for several years. This algorithm can (within
  limits) process articulatory movements that users cannot achieve when they
  start to use the system. This property is indispensable for the targeted
  therapeutic applications. The algorithm exploits a probabilistic model based
  on a large articulatory database acquired from an "expert" speaker capable of
  pronouncing all of the sounds in one or more languages. This model is
  automatically adapted to the morphology of each new user, over the course of a
  short system calibration phase, during which the patient must pronounce a few
  phrases.
