Abstract:

Although fish farming in Africa is developing in the last decade, it still has a big potential of growth to meet the fish demand with growing population. One of the key parameters for a successful fish farm business is the water quality monitoring. Even though it is essential, it is often too expensive for African fish farmers to monitor their ponds. In the WAZIUP project, we deployed a low-cost and connected water monitoring system measuring pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature in a fish farm in Ghana. It has been collecting data since February 2017 and we present here the first conclusions of the water analysis and the impact it could have on fish farming. Based on these results, we aim to deploy several improved V2 prototypes in early 2018.
