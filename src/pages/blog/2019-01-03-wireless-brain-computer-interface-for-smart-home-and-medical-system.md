  The number of aged and disabled people has been increasing worldwide. To look
  after these people is a big challenge in this era. However, scientists
  overcome the problems of handicapped people with the help of the latest
  communication technologies. The smart home and medical systems are a
  predominant concept in research and development, specially utilizing the
  brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to control the daily use appliances.
  BCI acquires the brain signals that transmit to a digital device for analyzing
  and interpreting into further command or action but this approach limits the
  communication range between the brain and the system and becomes bulky because
  of the wired interface of a brain with the system. Therefore, the main purpose
  of this research was to design and evaluate a system that empowered the
  immobilized, handicapped or elderly people to carry out their basic routine
  tasks wirelessly, for instance, operating home appliances and monitoring vital
  signs without any dependency. In addition, the subject should have a properly
  functioning brain and controlled with eye muscle movement. In this research
  work, wireless BCI (WBCI) technology that is a commercial electroencephalogram
  headset is used to control home and medical appliances such as a light bulb, a
  fan, a digital blood pressure monitor and an Infrared deep pain therapeutic
  belt for dependent people. An Android application is developed name “Smart
  Home Monitor” that monitors the data from the headset. The designed device is
  tested on younger (50-year-old) and older (> 50-year-old) individuals to
  achieve an attention level (0–100). The younger male reached attention level
  74.78 within 26.20 s; quicker than younger female and older people. Overall,
  this research work is unique for the reason that it is suitable for all those
  people, whose brain and eye muscles are functional even if the rest of the
  body is paralyzed. This analysis evaluated WBCI device enables the system to
  be wireless, handy, portable and reliable. Thus, the whole system can be
  commercialized for immobilized or handicapped people to provide better care
  and facility at home. Especially, the disable people appreciated this system
  and want to see its implementation as soon as possible.
