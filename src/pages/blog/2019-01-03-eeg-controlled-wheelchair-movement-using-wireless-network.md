  This project discusses about a brain controlled wheel chair based on
  Brain–computer interfaces (BCI). BCI’s are systems that can bypass
  conventional channels of communication (i.e., muscles and thoughts) to provide
  direct communication and control between the human brain and physical devices
  by translating different patterns of brain activity into commands in real
  time. The intention of the project work is to develop a robot that can assist
  the disabled people in their daily life to do some work independent of others.
  Here, we analyze the brain wave signals. Human brain consists of millions of
  interconnected neurons, the pattern of interaction between these neurons are
  represented as thoughts and emotional states. According to the human thoughts,
  this pattern will be changing which in turn produce different electrical
  waves. A muscle contraction will also be generate a unique electrical signal.
  All this electrical waves will be sensed by the brain wave sensor it will
  convert the data into packets and transmit through Bluetooth medium. Level
  analyzer unit (LAU) will receive the brain wave raw data and it will extract
  and process the signal using MATLAB platform. Then the control commands will
  be transmitted to the robot module to process. With this entire system, we can
  move a robot according to the human thoughts and it can be turned by blink
  muscle contraction
