  The researcher in this study intends to focus not only on the effect of music
  on reading but also on the effects of music on extroverts – introverts
  personality dimensions. The main question this study tried to answer was
  whether listening to music as a background might enhance students' reading
  scores. A total of 68 language learners from Eresk educational group
  participated voluntarily in this study. They were selected out of 83 students,
  employing Nelson proficiency test and were randomly assigned to two groups.
  Before distributing the tests, Fog index was calculated to determine the
  readability of the texts. The texts were at upper- intermediate level. The
  participants in experimental group were asked to read three texts accompanying
  by music background, but the subjects in the control group were asked to read
  the same texts without background music during three sessions. To see if there
  is a significant difference between the reading scores of the two groups,
  Independent Samples t-test was run. Statistical analysis was applied for the
  effect size, Mauchly's Test of Sphericity and one-way repeated measure ANOVA.
  At the end, Pearson correlation coefficient showed the relationship between
  scores of students’ performance and scores of introversion- extroversion
  scale. The results of the present study indicated that background music has
  the potential as a facilitator not as a distraction to be used as an effective
  aid for reading classes.
