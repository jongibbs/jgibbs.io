Hey girl!

The way you make me feel

I know your love is real

You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!

You're always on my mind

We need to spend more time

Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

She look so good in her clothes

She get dressed and roll

So much man a fly down, Call the pest control

Confident princess, She address them bold

She nah manifest, Fi them sexual goal

She wish them the best, Rasta bless them soul

Her mouth nuh filthy, Like nuh cess tank pool

Smarter than most intellectual fools

Weh spend them time pon internet chat rooms

She said, "Junior you're a genius

You think with your mind and not your penis

Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos

Drinking Blue Mountain cappuccinos."

Will I say, "Baby you're the cleanest

The true definition of what my queen is

Nothing could've ever really come between us

Share the same room and Jah will feed us."

Hey girl!

The way you make me feel

I know your love is real

You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!

You're always on my mind

We need to spend more time

Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

Why mi love her fi all she's worth

Sitn' fi gwan she wi start it first

Wheel and pop off, Supn' outta she purse

Whole heap a fool have to start disperse

Police ah come you see how fast she splurt

Can't find no sign of she khaki skirt

Light up the place like we spark these herbs

Love watch the way that she gwan

When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set

Selector rewind every chance them get

The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat

All when morning ashine she nuh start dance yet

Man clear the line when she walk and step

But she nah pay no mind to remarks them mek

Always on time take a chance and bet

She's a fine piece of mind with right mindset

She said, "Junior you're a genius

You think with you're mind and not you're peanuts

Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos

Drinking Blue Mountain cappuccinos."

I say, "Baby you're the cleanest

The true definition of what my queen is

Nothing could've ever really come between us

Share the same room and Jah will feed us."

Hey girl!

The way you make me feel

I know your love is real

You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!

You're always on my mind

We need to spend more time

Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

So boom!

Animal you never know from you born

Places you only see when travel channel tun on

Our means of trans-p is when the camel run on

Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion

"Fliminitti" weh she have and that is the attraction

What she want is what she get and that is satisfaction

Well she want it all night and not just fi a fraction

Well too much long talking now a time fi action

Well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time

And if mi gone fi ten minute, She call me ten time

If mi nuh pick up then she panic

Then she call mi friend line

Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine

A substantial amount of African fly squat

I have to sip a roots and bun a one night cap

And she love the veteran, him always hit the right spot

And the way she feel so good

I have to bounce right back

Hey girl!

The way you make me feel

I know your love is real

You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!

You're always on my mind

We need to spend more time

Cause no one else can touch my heart inside
