\[Verse 1]

Hey brother

There's an endless road to rediscover

Hey sister

Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker



\[Pre-Chorus]

Oh, if the sky comes falling down

For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do



\[Verse 2]

Hey brother

Do you still believe in one another?

Hey sister

Do you still believe in love?

I wonder



\[Pre-Chorus]

Oh, if the sky comes falling down

For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do



\[Chorus]

What if I'm far from home?

Oh brother, I will hear you call!

What if I lose it all?

Oh sister, I will help you out!

Oh, if the sky comes falling down

For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do



\[Verse 3]

Hey brother

There's an endless road to rediscover

Hey sister

Do you still believe in love? I wonder



\[Pre-Chorus]

Oh, if the sky comes falling down

For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do



\[Chorus]

What if I'm far from home?

Oh brother, I will hear you call!

What if I lose it all?

Oh sister, I will help you out!

Oh, if the sky comes falling down

For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
