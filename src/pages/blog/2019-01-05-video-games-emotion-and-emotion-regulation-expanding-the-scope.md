description: >-
  Recent years have seen important advances in the study of video games, with
  many scholars examining how video games impact emotional experiences of
  players. While this research borrows heavily from traditional media effects
  paradigms, it has proceeded without effectively integrating developments in
  emotion and emotion regulation. Therefore, this paper first reviews the nature
  of emotion and emotion regulation, and then reviews the extant video game
  literature. We next draw on theoretical accounts of emotion to frame three
  broad research questions that may advance future work on video games and
  emotions: (1) What is the nature of video game-evoked emotional experiences?
  (2) What are the processes through which video games produce emotions? (3) How
  are video games used to regulate emotions?
