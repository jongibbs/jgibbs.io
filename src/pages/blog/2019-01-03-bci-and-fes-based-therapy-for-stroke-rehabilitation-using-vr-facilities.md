  In recent years, the assistive technologies and stroke rehabilitation methods
  have been empowered by the use of virtual reality environments and the
  facilities offered by brain computer interface systems and functional
  electrical stimulators. In this paper, a therapy system for stroke
  rehabilitation based on these revolutionary techniques is presented. Using a
  virtual reality Oculus Rift device, the proposed system ushers the patient in
  a virtual scenario where a virtual therapist coordinates the exercises aimed
  at restoring brain function. The electrical stimulator helps the patient to
  perform rehabilitation exercises and the brain computer interface system and
  an electrooculography device are used to determine if the exercises are
  executed properly. Laboratory tests on healthy people led to system validation
  from technical point of view. The clinical tests are in progress, but the
  preliminary results of the clinical tests have highlighted the good
  satisfaction degree of patients, the quick accommodation with the proposed
  therapy, and rapid progress for each user rehabilitation.
