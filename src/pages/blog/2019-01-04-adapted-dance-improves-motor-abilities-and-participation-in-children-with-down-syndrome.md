  Purpose: This pilot study measured effects of an adapted dance program on
  motor abilities and participation in children with Down syndrome (DS) and
  explored caregivers' qualitative feedback regarding its benefits.


  Methods: Children with DS participated in 20 weekly 1-hour adapted dance
  sessions. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Gross Motor
  Function Measure (GMFM) Dimensions D and E were administered before and after
  the program. Caregivers completed a survey at the last session.


  Results: Six children completed pre- and postassessments. Significant
  improvements were noted in GMFM-88 measures. Caregivers of 5 participants
  reported improved scores on the COPM that were not significant. Caregivers
  reported physical, cognitive, and emotional improvements.


  Conclusions: This study supports use of an adapted dance program to improve
  motor abilities and participation in children with DS.
