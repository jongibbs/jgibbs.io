  All of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sequence in
  which foods are consumed affects both food intake and preference.
  Understanding the importance of sequencing when herbivores consume foods that
  vary in nutrients and secondary compounds may help managers create new grazing
  strategies that include sequential foraging patterns to optimize food intake
  and more evenly use all plant species in a community, a practice used by
  herders in France.
