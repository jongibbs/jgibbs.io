  ---------------------------------------Abstract------------------------------------------------------[Avena,
  N.M., Rada, P., Hoebel B.G., 2007. Evidence for sugar addiction: Behavioral
  and neurochemical effects of intermittent, excessive sugar intake.
  Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews XX(X), XXX–XXX]. The experimental
  question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a
  natural form of addiction. “Food addiction” seems plausible because brain
  pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by
  addictive drugs. Sugar is noteworthy as a substance that releases opioids and
  dopamine and thus might be expected to have addictive potential. This review
  summarizes evidence of sugar dependence in an animal model. Four components of
  addiction are analyzed. “Bingeing,” “withdrawal,” “craving” and
  “cross-sensitization” are each given operational definitions and demonstrated
  behaviorally with sugar bingeing as the reinforcer. These behaviors are then
  related to neurochemical changes in the brain that also occur with addictive
  drugs. Neural adaptations include changes in dopamine and opioid receptor
  binding, enkephalin mRNA expression and dopamine and acetylcholine release in
  the nucleus accumbens. The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain
  circumstances rats can become sugar dependent. This may translate to some
  human conditions as suggested by the literature on eating disorders and
  obesity.
